# Data Discovery
- Topic Analysis
  - Topical (dis-)similarity between authors
  - Making sure it is not turning into a topic classification task (balance is important)
  - Measure the difference between two authors' topic probability distribution (using KL divergence).

# Classifier
- Adding a layer of emotional/sentiment analysis (if by using a different classifying method)
- Exploring POS
- Exploring the existence/frequency of NE
